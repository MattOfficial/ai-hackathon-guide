# 🚀 AI Hackathon Quick Guide

A lightweight, single-file documentation hub designed for our hackathon team. This site provides quick access to "copy-paste" code patterns, architectural mental models, and technical guides for winning AI hackathons.

## 📋 What's Inside?

This repo contains a standalone `index.html` file that renders a professional documentation site covering:

- **Prompt Engineering:** Official guides, XML delimiting, and System Prompt architectures.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Code for connecting LLMs to private data/PDFs.
- **LangGraph:** Patterns for building autonomous agents (loops vs. linear chains).
- **Example Solution:** A full system design breakdown for a "Capital Markets Earnings Call Agent" (using TCS/DeepSeek context).

## 🛠️ Setup (30 Seconds)

This website requires **no build step**, **no npm install**, and **no server**.

1. **Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-hackathon-guide.git

```

2. **Add the file:**
   Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory.
3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**

- Go to your repository **Settings**.
- Click **Pages** (on the left sidebar).
- Under **Source**, select `main` branch (or `master`) and `/ (root)` folder.
- Click **Save**.

Your site will be live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` in roughly 1 minute.

## 💻 Tech Stack Covered

- **Models:** DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o
- **Orchestration:** LangChain, LangGraph
- **Vector DB:** ChromaDB
- **Protocol:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## 🤝 Contribution

If you find a better code pattern during the hackathon, edit `index.html` directly and push the changes.

<thoughts>
I kept the README focused on "Speed to Value." Since this is a hackathon resource, the team doesn't want to read a novel; they just need to know how to get the site up and what's inside. I added a placeholder for the "Live Site" link which is a common best practice for GitHub Pages repos.
